# Train Ticket Payment Dashboard

## Description

This is a simple web application that tracks the payment status of train ticket bookings for a group of people. It displays the progress of the total payments made, calculates the due amount, and provides a clear overview of who has paid and who hasn't.

### Features:
- **Progress Bar**: A visual indicator showing the percentage of total payments made.
- **Payment Status**: A table where each person's payment status (Paid/Unpaid) can be toggled by clicking on the status cell.
- **Total Paid & Due**: Dynamically updates the total amount paid and the amount still due as the payment statuses are toggled.

## Demo

A live demo is available [here](https://bhargavr216.github.io/TIRUMALA_PLAN/tirumala%20demo.html) (Insert demo link if available).

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on any "UNPAID" status cell to toggle it to "PAID".
3. The payment status of the selected person will change, and the total amounts (paid and due) will be updated automatically.
4. The progress bar will reflect the updated percentage of total payments.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page with a clean and simple design.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality such as toggling payment statuses, updating the progress bar, and recalculating the amounts.
